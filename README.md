This code is about the path tracking control using model predictive control with friction parameter learning.

DDP code comes from "https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/52069-ilqg-ddp-trajectory-optimization".

This control scheme is also called model-based RL in which planning and learning are repeated to minimize the given cost.
